D-STAR SWITCHING MATRIX TOOLKIT

The goal of the DSTK is as simple as ambitious: design a system able to switch any kind of 
D-STAR related stream, from any input to any output and -at the mean time- process it in any
way possible.


Sounds interesting?


Look into the README.txt document in the docs/ directory. :-)
