D-STAR SWITCHING MATRIX TOOLKIT

The goal of the DSTK is as simple as ambitious: design a system able to switch any kind of 
D-STAR related stream, from any input to any output and -at the mean time- process it in any
way possible.

Possible "Streams" can be:
- AMBE digital voice streams
- PCM or any other non-AMBE encoded digital voice streams
- slow-speed data
- digital data
- logging information



Input can be:
- AMBE Digital-Voice sources:
-> streams originating on a local RF-module
-> streams originating from a remote system, coming in over the internet using the callsign routing protocol
-> streams from remote repeaters or reflectors using linking protocols
-> local files in AMBE format

- non-AMBE Digital-Voice sources:
-> analog input via the "audio in" from a server
-> local files in PCM format
-> application generating PCM streams
-> voip-applications
-> audio-streams from
