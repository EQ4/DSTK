Format description TYPE_RPC subframe structure
----------------------------------------------


This document described the format of the DSTK subframe
structure containing TYPE_RPC data.


* General overview

A TYPE_RPC data stream is a DSTK substream that contains a copy
of the data send from a i-com D-STAR repeater gatewayserver and
a i-COM D-STAR repeater-controller. (hence its name "RPC" stream).

It is the starting point of to process Digital Voice (DV) and Digital
Data (DD) traffic passing over an i-com based D-STAR repeater.

RPC-streams are created by the "cap2rpc" application which intercepts
the traffic on the ethernet interface of the D-STAR gateway server
facing the RPC (usually eth1).
To achieve this, cap2rpc uses the "libpcap" library. cap2rpc is the
only application of the DSTK application stack that needs
root-priviledges.

Other applications (like rpc2amb) subscribe to the RPC stream for
further processing. 


* structure

In essence, it just contains a copy of the IP packet exchanged
from the IP-layer upwards.

A D-STAR RPC substream packet concists of a fixed lenght header,
followed by a variable lenght data part.

The structure of the header is as follows:
- octets 0-15: IPv4 header
- octets 16-23: UDP header

- octets 24-33: the "D-STAR RPC header":
-> octets 24-27: signature 'DSTR'
-> octets 28-29: pkt_num
-> octet 30: RS flag
-> octet 31: PKT type
-> octet 32-33: D-STAR data len

See the file "include/dss_rpc.h" for more information



* Flags:
No flags are set on the TYPE_RPC streams. Even excluding the FLG_DIR
(direction) flag.
